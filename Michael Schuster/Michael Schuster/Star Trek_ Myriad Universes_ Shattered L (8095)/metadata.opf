        <dc:description>&lt;h3&gt;Product Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been said that for any event, there are an infinite number of possible out­comes. Our choices determine which outcome will follow, and therefore all possibilities that could happen do happen across alternate realities. In these divergent realms, known history is bent, like white light through a shattered prism—broken into a boundless spectrum of what-might-have-beens. But in those myriad universes, what might have been . . . is what actually occurred. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE EMBRACE OF COLD ARCHITECTS.&lt;/strong&gt; “Mister Worf—fire.” With thosewords, William T. Riker defeated the Borg—and destroyed Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Now, a heartsore Captain Riker must carry on the legacy of thecommanding officer and friend whose death he ordered. But crises face himat every turn, from Cardassian aggression to the return of Data’s creator,Noonien Soong. But it is Data’s creation of a daughter, Lal, that may prove to beeveryone’s undoing. . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE TEARS OF ERIDANUS.&lt;/strong&gt; Commander Hikaru Sulu of the &lt;em&gt;Kumari&lt;/em&gt;—finest ship of the Interstellar Guard, the military arm of the Interstellar Union that includes Andor, Earth, and Tellar—is sent to rescue an observation team on a primitive desert planet. The world has many names—40 Eridani A-II, Minshara, T’Khasi, Vulcan—and its savage natives have taken the team hostage, including Sulu’s daughter, Demora. Even as Captain Sulu negotiates with the fierce T’Pau, Demora meets the elderly S’oval, and with him the only hope for the planet’s future. . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HONOR IN THE NIGHT.&lt;/strong&gt; Former Federation president Nilz Baris has died. After losing Sherman’s Planet to the Klingons thanks to poisoned quadrotriticale, the agriculture undersecretary parlayed that defeat into years of political battles with the Klingon Empire, and eventually the Federation’s highest office. Now, the Federation News Service wants the story of his life, a quest that digs up many secrets—including the mystery of why his final words were “Arne Darvin.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;About the Author&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAVID R. GEORGE III&lt;/strong&gt; wrote the Crucible trilogy for Star Trek's 40th anniversary as well as &lt;em&gt;Olympus Descending&lt;/em&gt; for Worlds of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Volume Three. He previously visited DS9 in the novels &lt;em&gt;The 34th Rule&lt;/em&gt;, set during the timeframe of the series, and in &lt;em&gt;Twilight&lt;/em&gt;, set after the finale. His other Star Trek contributions include a first season Voyager episode, "Prime Factors," and one of the_ Lost Era _books, &lt;em&gt;Serpents Among the Ruins,&lt;/em&gt; which hit the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller list in Fall, 2003. Currently he is writing a novella for &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Myriad Universes: Shattered Light&lt;/em&gt;, coming in December, 2010, from Gallery Books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his almost nonexistent spare time, David enjoys trying his hand at new experiences, from skydiving to auditioning--with his lovely wife, Karen--for "The New Newlywed Game", from hiking a glacier in Alaska to belly dancing in Tunisia, from ocean kayaking in Mexico to having dinner at an actual captain's table somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. Recently, he performed his first wedding ceremony--which he and Karen also wrote--marrying their friends Jen and Ryan Van Riper. David believes that the world is a wide, wondrous place, with exciting adventures waiting around just about every corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He remains free on his own recognizance.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STEVE MOLLMANN&lt;/strong&gt; is studying for a Ph.D. in English at an unknown university at an unknown location in the United States. He is not being coy; at the time this was written, he simply had no idea where he would be by the time you read this. He obtained his M.A. in English at the University of Connecticut, and hopes to pursue a career as a scholar, specializing in British literature, especially its intersection with science and technology. Also in that gap of time, he will have gotten married to his then-fiancÉe, Hayley. He has met Michael Schuster on more than one occasion.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MICHAEL SCHUSTER&lt;/strong&gt; lives in a picturesque Austrian mountain valley, with half a continent and one entire ocean between him and Steve Mollmann. A bank employee by day, he likes to come up with new (or at least relatively unused) ideas that can be turned into stories with loving care and the occasional nudge. With Steve, he is the co-author of two short stories in the anthology &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation: The Sky's the Limit&lt;/em&gt;. Their first novel, &lt;em&gt;The Tears of Eridanus&lt;/em&gt;, will be released as part of the collection &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Myriad Universes: Shattered Light &lt;/em&gt;this December. Currently, the two are hard at work building their own universe-sized sandbox to play in. More information about them (including annotations for &lt;em&gt;The Future Begins&lt;/em&gt;) can be found at http://www.exploringtheuniverse.net/. &lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>
