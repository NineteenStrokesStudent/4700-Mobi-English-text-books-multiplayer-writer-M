        <dc:description>&lt;h3&gt;From Publishers Weekly&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on a range of sources, in addition to The Odyssey, Atwood scripts the narrative of Penelope, the faithful and devoted wife of Odysseus and her 12 maids, who were killed upon the master's return. Atwood proposes striking interpretations of her characters that challenge the patriarchal nature of Greek mythology. The chapters transition between the firsthand account of Penelope and the chorus of maids as listeners are taken from Penelope's early life to her afterlife. Laural Merlington charmingly delivers the witty and perceptive Penelope with realistic inflection and emphasis. Some of her vocal caricatures seem over the top, but most voices maintain a resemblance to our perceptions of these mythic people. The maids are presented as a saddened chorus by a cloning of Merlington's voice. These dark figures speak straightforwardly in their accusations of Penelope and Odysseus, while, at other times, they make use of rhyming. This format works well, though sometimes the cadence and rhyming scheme are off beat. This benefits the production by creating an eerie resonance and haunting demeanor that enhances this engaging tale.&lt;br /&gt;Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Review&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Bestseller  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;The Penelopiad&lt;/strong&gt;_ _is a brilliant tour de force that takes an aspect of &lt;strong&gt;The Odyssey&lt;/strong&gt;_ _and opens up new vistas. . . . Atwood takes Penelope’s braininess and puts her at the centre. . . . Odysseus’s 20-year absence leaves lots of room for development; this is just the kind of thing that a retelling of a myth should do. . . . [Atwood] turns a gruesome, barbaric episode into an ironic tragedy of double agents.” &lt;br /&gt;–_National Post_  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Two things are apparent when you begin reading &lt;strong&gt;The Penelopiad&lt;/strong&gt;. First, this is a writer who is confidently at the height of her powers. And, second, she’s having fun.” &lt;br /&gt;–_The Vancouver Sun&lt;br /&gt;_&lt;br /&gt;“Atwood’s putting Penelope in the starring role is a fine and fresh revisioning. . . . Somehow (it is a measure of her genius that one cannot quite say how), she makes us hear the voice of Penelope, reflecting in Hades on her life, as if it were the voice of the most interesting gossip you have ever had coffee with. . . . This is a wonderful book.” &lt;br /&gt;–_The Globe and Mail _  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Feels like a breath of fresh air blown in from the Mediterranean Sea. . . . &lt;strong&gt;The Penelopiad&lt;/strong&gt;_ _is Atwood in top form. The woman who wrote &lt;strong&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/strong&gt;_ _hasn’t lost her acerbic touch.” &lt;br /&gt;–_The Gazette _(Montreal)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What . . . emerge[s] is a startling commentary on the responsibility of power, and of how privilege can shade into complicity. &lt;strong&gt;The Penelopiad&lt;/strong&gt;_ &lt;em&gt;is anything but a woe-is-woman discourse. . . . &lt;/em&gt; _adds Atwood’s sly, compassionate voice to the myth of Odysseus and Penelope and, in doing so, increases its already great depth.”&lt;br /&gt;–_Calgary Herald_  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this exquisitely poised book, Atwood blends intimate humour with a finely tempered outrage at the terrible injustice of the maids, phrasing both in language as potent as a curse.” &lt;br /&gt;–_Sunday Times _(UK)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Penelope flies with the help of the sardonic, dead-pan voice Atwood lends her, a tone — half Dorothy Parker, half Desperate housewives.” &lt;br /&gt;–_The Independent _(UK)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“‘Spry’ is a word that could almost have been invented to describe Margaret Atwood, who beadily and wittily retells the events surrounding &lt;strong&gt;The Odyssey&lt;/strong&gt;_ _through the voice of Penelope. Pragmatic, clever, domestic, mournful, Penelope is a perfect Atwood heroine.” &lt;br /&gt;–_The Spectator _(UK)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alter[s] one’s point of view toward [the story], imbuing it with a modern sensibility yet revealing some eternal truths about men, women, and the issue of power, including the power to shape a narrative. . . . Atwood shows with intelligence and wit just how complicated and unpretty love can be.” &lt;br /&gt;–_O, The Oprah Magazine_  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Along with her presentation of the hallucinatory maids and Penelope’s straight talk about her husband, her girly laments about the ferocious competition of Helen and her queenly worries about fending off the suitors, Atwood’s brilliance emerges in the skillful way she has woven her own research on the anthropological underpinnings of Homer’s epic into the patterns of her own stylized version of the poem. . . . A fascinating and rather attractive version of this old, old story, a creation tale about the founding of our civilization meant to be heard over and over and over.” &lt;br /&gt;–_Chicago Tribune &lt;br /&gt;_&lt;br /&gt;“Atwood paints a shrewdly insightful picture of what life in those days might actually have been like. . . . By turns slyly funny and fiercely indignant, Ms. Atwood’s imaginative, ingeniously-constructed ‘deconstruction’ of the old tale reveals it in a new–and refreshingly different–light.” &lt;br /&gt;–_The Washington Times  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;_“Atwood’s 17th work of fiction is a gem…flaunts an acid wit and a generous dose of lyricism…In Atwood’s imagination, Penelope and her handmaids are remarkably complex: They are simultaneously ancient and modern, lighthearted and grief-stricken, disenfranchised and powerful.”&lt;br /&gt;–_Baltimore Sun_&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>
